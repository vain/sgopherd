Release history for sgopherd

  [LICENSING]
  - The project has been relicensed under the MIT license (more
    precisely called "Expat License", but everyone calls it "MIT
    license" these days).

  [Changed]
  - When using systemd, we now expect it to set the environment variable
    $REMOTE_ADDR, which happens since systemd 220. The systemd-specific
    wrapper script has been removed.

v17.02  2017-02-12
  [Fixed]
  - .IGNORE files work again. They used to internally set $GLOBIGNORE,
    which appears to have changed its behaviour. We now manually test
    patterns listed in .IGNORE files.

v16.08 and earlier
  - Sorry, the CHANGES file did not exist back then. Please refer to the
    git history.
