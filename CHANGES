Release history for sgopherd

v17.02  2017-02-12
  [Fixed]
  - .IGNORE files work again. They used to internally set $GLOBIGNORE,
    which appears to have changed its behaviour. We now manually test
    patterns listed in .IGNORE files.

v16.08 and earlier
  - Sorry, the CHANGES file did not exist back then. Please refer to the
    git history.
