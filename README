sgopherd is a simple gopher server for Unix-like systems, preferably
GNU or OpenBSD.


Installation
------------

As sgopherd is a Bash script, there is no build process. However, the
program relies on several external utilities:

    - GNU sed or OpenBSD sed
    - GNU file or OpenBSD file
    - logger (usually part of util-linux)
    - (x)inetd or systemd

If you're on Arch Linux, you can use the following AUR package:

    - https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/sgopherd-git/


Running
-------

sgopherd does not implement any "daemon" functionality, thus you need to
use xinetd or systemd's socket activation. You will also need to set up
your gopher hole which will probably need to include some index files.

Refer to the manpage for further details.
